# Bangla News Categorization
Using Machine Learning models to detect the category of Bangla news articles by analyzing the key features for each of the defined categories. This project was done as part of my Final Year Thesis (CSE-400 and CSE-408).

Main project file is the following file:

We publised two papers from this project. One of our works was published in "2017 20th International Conference of Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT), Dhaka, 2017". Here we discussed about the effects of different kernels of SVM in Bangla News Categorization. The paper can be found in the folling link:

The second paper was accepted at the "Journal of Computer Science" (Volume 16, No. 3, 2020, Pages: 378-390). You may read the paper to understand how we used category specific feature extraction technique to solve the problem of Bangla News Categorization along with a Multi Layer Perceptron model.
